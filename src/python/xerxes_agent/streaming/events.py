"""Typed streaming events for the Xerxes agent loop.

Inspired by the nano-claude-code event protocol, this module defines a set of
typed dataclasses that represent discrete events during streaming agent
execution. A generator-based agent loop yields these events, allowing the
consumer (TUI, API server, etc.) to handle each event type independently.

Event types:

- :class:`TextChunk` — Incremental text from the model.
- :class:`ThinkingChunk` — Incremental thinking/reasoning text.
- :class:`ToolStart` — A tool invocation is about to begin.
- :class:`ToolEnd` — A tool invocation has completed (with result).
- :class:`PermissionRequest` — The loop is requesting user permission.
- :class:`TurnDone` — An LLM turn has completed (with token counts).

The :data:`StreamEvent` type alias is the union of all event types.

Usage::

    from xerxes_agent.streaming.events import TextChunk, ToolStart, ToolEnd

    for event in agent_loop(...):
        match event:
            case TextChunk(text=t):
                print(t, end="")
            case ToolStart(name=n):
                print(f"\\n[tool] {n} ...")
            case ToolEnd(name=n, result=r):
                print(f"[tool] {n} → {r[:80]}")
